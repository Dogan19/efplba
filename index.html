                During 1941, codebreaking at Bletchley Park was hindered by shortages of typists
                and unskilled staff. These shortages could have been easily rectified, but the
                codebreakers’ urgent requests were ignored by officials in Whitehall. Going over
                the heads of those in command at GC & CS, Turing and his co-signatories wrote
                directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. On receiving the letter
                Churchill minuted his Chief of Staff, General Ismay: ‘action this day
                Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that
                this had been done.’¹
                <br>
            <span id="span1">It fell to Stuart Milner-Barry of Hut 6 to deliver the letter by hand to 10
            Downing Street. In 1986, Milner-Barry recalled his trip to Whitehall:</span>

                <span id="span2">
                Why I was deputed to carry the letter to No. 10 I do not remember—at a guess, because I
                was the most readily expendable from the scene of action. What I do recall is arriving at
                Euston Station, hailing a taxi, and with a sense of total incredulity (can this really be
                happening?) inviting the driver to take me to 10 Downing Street. The taxi-driver never
                blinked an eyelid: without comment he directed himself to Whitehall. Arrived at the
                entrance to Downing Street, I was again surprised at the lack of formality: there was just a
                wooden barrier across the road, and one uniformed policeman who waved my driver on.
                At the door to No. 10 I paid oV the taxi, rang the bell, was courteously ushered in,
                explained that I had an urgent letter which I was anxious to deliver to the Prime Minister

            personally, and was invited to wait. Of course I did not see the Prime Minister himself;
            but very shortly there appeared a dapper dark-suited Wgure of shortish stature whom
            I subsequently identiWed as Brigadier Harvie-Watt, Mr. Churchill’s PPS from 1941 to
            1945. To him I again explained my errand; and while obviously and understandably
            puzzled as to who I might be and what this was all about, he took me suYciently seriously
            to promise that he would without fail deliver the letter to the Prime Minister and stress its
            urgency. That accomplished, I took my leave and took myself back to Bletchley by the next
            train. It was some forty years later before I found out what happened to that letter, when I
            saw the Prime Minister’s minute dated the following day. . . All that we did notice was
            that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. The
            Xow of bombes was speeded up, the staV bottlenecks were relieved, and we were able to
            devote ourselves uninterruptedly to the business in hand.²

            some days later, and he made some rather wry remark about our unorthodox
            behaviour; but he was much too nice a man to bear malice.’

            </div>
                                             Dear Prime Minister,
            Some weeks ago you paid us the honour of a visit, and we believe that you
            regard our work as important. You will have seen that, thanks largely to the
            energy and foresight of Commander Travis, we have been well supplied with the
            ‘bombes’ for the breaking of the German Enigma codes. We think, however, that
            you ought to know that this work is being held up, and in some cases is not being
            done at all, principally because we cannot get suYcient staV to deal with it. Our
            reason for writing to you direct is that for months we have done everything that
            we possibly can through the normal channels, and that we despair of any early
            improvement without your intervention. No doubt in the long run these particular requirements will be met, but meanwhile still more precious months will
            have been wasted, and as our needs are continually expanding we see little hope
            of ever being adequately staVed.
            We realise that there is a tremendous demand for labour of all kinds and that
            its allocation is a matter of priorities. The trouble to our mind is that as we are a
            very small section with numerically trivial requirements it is very diYcult to
            bring home to the authorities Wnally responsible either the importance of what is
            done here or the urgent necessity of dealing promptly with our requests. At the
            same time we Wnd it hard to believe that it is really impossible to produce quickly
            the additional staV that we need, even if this meant interfering with the normal
            machinery of allocations.
            We do not wish to burden you with a detailed list of our diYculties, but the
            following are the bottlenecks which are causing us the most acute anxiety.
            1. Breaking of Naval Enigma (Hut 8)
            Owing to shortage of staV and the overworking of his present team the Hollerith
            section here under Mr Freeborn has had to stop working night shifts. The eVect
            of this is that the Wnding of the naval keys is being delayed at least twelve hours
            every day. In order to enable him to start night shifts again Freeborn needs
            immediately about twenty more untrained Grade III women clerks. To put
            himself in a really adequate position to deal with any likely demands he will
            want a good many more.
